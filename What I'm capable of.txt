
To begin with, I do not have any decryption keys nor exploits or what so ever.
As soon as you use a theme the PS4 immediately decrypts the pkg files, 
they are then saved in one place. What my tool does is it downloads those decrypted 
content files of the THEME.pkg

Cool stuff you can do with the files you can use them dynamic themes and make 
a phone/PC/PSvita theme with sounds & background music
Note: PlayStation systems use special sound/music format (at9, at10)
      that are quite rare there many ways to convert them to mp3

You may also change the bgm and repackage the theme and install it back.
